Project for DSCI-549: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

## Part 1: Data 

1.	Define an interesting problem that could be answered through data analysis. Describe the problem to a non-informed audience 
2.	Find one or more datasets on the Web that are relevant to these questions, and that are: 1) accessible, 2) released with an open license, and 3) machine processable. For one of the datasets, specify:
a.	A brief description of what the data represents, with a small excerpt of the data as an example 
b.	A discussion on how the dataset satisfies the three criteria above 
c.	The details for how you can access the data 
                Use the technical terms that you have learned in class to describe data.


## Part 2: Hypothesis (30 points) 

1.	Is the study you want to conduct experimental or observational? Why? How does that affect your conclusions? 
2.	State the null and alternate hypothesis 
3.	What are the dependent and independent variables? 
4.	
## Part 3: Data exploration 

1.	List and describe three data exploration steps that you will likely need. (note: visualization is acceptable as three separate steps as long as they allow you to explore three different characteristics of the dataset)
2.	For each of the steps, describe how it will help you with pre-processing and analysis. (i.e., if my visualization indicates outliers, then I can remove them).  

## Part 4: Pre-processing 

1.	List and describe three processing steps that you think are involved in the data science pipeline. 
2.	For each of the steps, what do you expect to achieve and how does it help your analysis?
3.	
## Part 5: Analysis 

1.	In your own words, give an overview of the analysis you would need to perform to answer your data science question. 
2.	Can you think of an algorithm learned in class that would be best to test your hypothesis? 
a.	If so, which one? Describe the algorithm
b.	If not, write down the algorithm

## Part 6: Workflow 

1.	Sketch the workflow for your data science problem, omitting the data exploration steps but including pre-processing and analysis. The workflow needs to include the data flow. The analysis step should be one component. 

## Part 7: Parallel processing  

1.	Can any steps be run in parallel? If so, which ones? Explain why you can/cannot do so. 

## Part 8: Provenance 

1.	Enter the PROV ontology in Protégé. 
2.	Create instances of entities, activities, use and generation, and agents for the analysis you are proposing to conduct. 
3.	Upload the .owl file with your homework. 

## Part 9: Data stewardship 

1.	Describe in details (include relevant software/website as we have done in class) the steps you would take to document and share
a.	The data 
b.	The software
c.	The workflow

## Part 10: Communicating data science

1.	Record a five minute presentation highlighting your problem, its relevance, and anticipated results. Your presentation should follow best practice as discussed in class. 
a.	Execution (organization, speech, timing) 
b.	Content (Context/importance of the study; hypothesis; method; anticipated results)
